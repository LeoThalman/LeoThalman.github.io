		<h1>Homework Nine</h1>
		  <p>For this assign we had to take our project from homework 8 and deploy it to the cloud. The purpose of this assignment is to get some experience
			deploying a project to the cloud, as well as set up an account so that we can do so.</p>
		  <p>The assignment can be found <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW9.html">here</a></p>
		  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
		  <p>Creating the account wasn't hard, I followed the link provided in and signed up for the account then went on to the process of deploying the project. First I had to create
			a resource group to hold everything. To do that I clicked on the resource group button in the menu on the left and the clicked the add button. doing that brought up the two tabs shown
			in the image below, I filled out the information and created the resource group.</p>

		  <h3>Creating Server and database</h3>
		  <p>Once I had the resource group created I could go on to creating the server and the database. I had to create the server first so that I had somewhere to put the database. I found that by going to
			SQL databases and trying to add one, which presented the add SQL database menu that let me go on to the create server menu.
		  </p>
  		  <img src="images/HW9/create-server.bmp">
		  <p>Once I had that done I went back to the create database menu and added in a new database for HW8, I dropped the pricing tier down to basic because the website doesn't need to be functional for a retail
		  scenario. Once that was deployed I grabbed the connection string from it and replaced the one I had in HW8 so that I could deploy the database to the new one I had just made.
		  </p>

		  <h3>Publishing the Website</h3>
		  <p>Now that I had the database connected and the tables populated it was time to publish the project. To do this I went under build and clicked on publish. This brought up a menu which asked me what I wanted the
			publish target to be, I chose Microsoft Azure App Service as thats where we're putting it and the following image is what came up next.

		  <p>Once that was done it brought up another connecting it brought up another menu saying that azure was configured and and option to publish with a dropdown menu next to it. I clicked the publish button and it began
		  the process of publishing this to azure. After a little bit I got back the okay from visual studio and checked the website to see everything working.</p>

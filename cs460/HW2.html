		<h1>Homework Two</h1>
		  <p>For this assignment we are to care a webpage that utilizes javascript and jquery to take input
			from the user and manipulate then present the output to the user on the same page. We also have 
			to create a new git branch called new-feature where we do all the updates to this webpage, and 
			then merge it back into the master branch once it is finished.</p>
		  <p>The assignment can be found <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW2.html">here</a></p>
		  <p>The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/LeoThalman/HW2">here</a></p>
		  <p>A demo can be seen <a href="HW2/index.html">here</a></p>
		<h3>Creating a new branch and wireframe mockup</h3>
		<p>The first step was to create the new folder and add a branch to it. After initializing the new git
		repo and linking it to a remote repo on github I added a new branch with</p>
		<code class="language-git">$ git checkout -b new-feature</code>
		<p>Once that was done I created an index.html and began to add the basic layout to the file. I decided on
		creating a simple form of a receipt tracker. This would allow the user to add an item with an amount and price
		and then would present that information with a total price once submitted. They could also add more items after
		and the total price would update with each item. The code below is the basic layout I created, with the add item
		boxes on the left and the item total information presented on the right.</p>
		<pre>
			<code class="language-html">
				&lt;body&gt;
				 &lt;h3 style="text-align:center;"&gt;Cost Tracker&lt;/h3&gt;
				 &lt;div class="row"&gt;
				 &lt;div class="col-sm-auto"&gt;
				   &lt;h4&gt;Add Item&lt;/h4&gt;
					 &lt;form&gt;
					   Item name:&lt;br&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="iName" value=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;		
					   Item amount:&lt;br&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="iAmount" value=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;	
					   Item price:&lt;br&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="iPrice" value=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
					   &lt;br&gt;	&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;
					 &lt;/form&gt;
				   &lt;/div&gt;
				   &lt;div class="col-sm-auto"&gt;
				   &lt;h4&gt;Item Total&lt;/h4&gt;		 
				   &lt;/div&gt;
				 &lt;/div&gt;
				&lt;/body&gt;			
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>After this I started looking into jquery and javascript to find the best way to grab the information
			from the page and maniuplate it. I started off looking into jquery and found a website called try.jquery.com
			to be quite helpful in learning about jquery. Although we did talk about it in class, the step by step walkthrough helped
			me to really grasp the basics of jquery. Once I had that down I created an application.js file and added jquery too.
		    With the javascript files added I began to work on pulling data out of the page with jquery.</p>
		<pre>
			<code class="language-js">
				var name = $('#iName').val();
				var amount = $('#iAmount').val();
				var price = $('#iPrice').val();
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>Before I did any error checking I made sure that all three variables were actually retrieving the right data.
			At first I tried to traverse to the input elements to pull the data out but I couldn't get it to work right so I settled
			on id'ing them and grabbing it that way. Once that was done I ran the variables through error checking and found out
			I had to adjust both the amount and price. When I was retrieving them it was giving them to me as strings so I put them in
			parse functions so I could use them later on.</p>
		<pre>
			<code class="language-js">
				var amount = parseInt($('#iAmount').val());
				var price = parseFloat($('#iPrice').val());
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>Adding rows to the table wasn't too bad. I id'd the last last row and had did an insertBefore on it so I could push the new
			row in right above and then had to find a way to keep track of the running total. At first I tried to do a forEach on the column
			that contained the values for total item price but I couldn't get that to work. Next I initialized an array outside the click function
			and started adding the items to that. For that I decided on making the items objects and pushing them into the array, so I could keep track
			of all the attributes. With that done I tried another forEach loop and it was still giving me problems so I went with a basic for loop
			and finally got it too add all item prices and update the data.</p>
		<pre>
			<code class="language-js">
				var total = amount * price;
				total = parseFloat(total.toFixed(2));
				var item = {iName : name, iAmount : amount, iPrice: price, iTotal : total};
				itemArr.push(item);
				var iRow = $('&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'+item.iName+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'+item.iAmount+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$'+item.iPrice+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;$'+item.iTotal+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;');
				var cTotal = 0;
				for(var i = 0; i &lt; itemArr.length; i+=1) {
					cTotal += itemArr[i].iTotal;
				}		
				iRow.insertBefore('.lRow');
				cTotal = parseFloat(cTotal.toFixed(2));
				$('#total').text('$'+cTotal);		
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>Once I had it working I began testing the code with multiple numbers and found that the float numbers would
			sometimes extend way past the decimal. To fix this I added the toFixed method to restrict it to 2 points past the
			decimal and then parsed the number back into a float. To be safe I did this for both the total and the running total.
			After that I added some css to style the page, I kept the style of it similar to homework one however I did add
			a red box for the error code to make it stand out more. The error code pops up below the add to list button to information
			the user if the enter any invalid information. After testing some more I felt satisfied and merged it back into master.</p>
		<pre>
			<code class="language-git">
				$ git checkout master
				$ git merge new-feature
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>After that I pushed it to the remote, which gave me an error saying that my master branch was behind remote and to pull
			it before merging and pushing. I tried pulling the branch but it didn't work and said that the two branches had unrelated history.
			I looked into it and found that I could do a push that would force it to work. Since I am the only one working out of this
			repo I did that but I'll have to be more careful in the future.

		<h1>Homework 1</h1>
		 <p>For this initial assignment we are tasked with setting up a local and remote repository using github or bitbucket,
			and then creating a website. Afterwards we're to set up a github pages to display both the work,
			and describe our process of solving the problem.</p>
			<p>The assignment can be found <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW1.html">here</a></p>
			<p>The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/LeoThalman/HW1">here</a></p>
			<p>A demo can be seen <a href="HW1/index.html">here</a></p>
		<h3>Creating and linking the repositories</h3>
		<p>the first thing I needed to do was set up an account with github. I've used github in the past to look
			at some code but i've never done anything else. Setting up the account wasn't much of an issue and after making
			it I set up the remote repo and started working on the local repo on my desktop.</p>		
		  <pre>	
			<code class="language-git">
				$ cd "cs 46x"/cs460/HW1
				$ git init
				$ git config --global user.name "LeoThalman"
				$ git config --global user.email "a@email.com"
				$ touch README.md
				$ git remote add origin "https://github.com/LeoThalman/HW1"
				$ git add README.md
				$ git push origin master
			</code>
		  </pre>
		<p>I used the code above to navigate into the folders I had set up for this project and initialize the git repo
			I then created a readme to push to the remote repo to make sure the connection worked. Afterwards I did a similar test
			on my laptop but instead pulled the README down. Working on both my laptop and desktop helped to get me used
			to the whole workflow of git in general. I had never used git to save work before so at first it was odd but after
			a couple days it became much easier to use. Now that i'm used to it I find it really helpful in easing the process of transferring
			my work from the desktop to the laptop and vice versa</p>
		<h3>Starting the Website</h3>
		<p>Creating the website was the easier of these tasks as i've built webpages in the past. However it has been a while since i've
			done any work with them so it took a little bit to get my bearings. I've never worked with bootstrap either so that was a new
			experience for me. To start off with I created a basic site to test out css and bootstrap.</p>
			
		<pre>
			<code class="language-html">
				&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
				&lt;html&gt;
				&lt;head&gt;
				&lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
				&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" type="text/css"&gt;
				&lt;title&gt;test Title&lt;/title&gt;
				&lt;/head&gt;
				&lt;h1&gt;test header&lt;/h1&gt;
				&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
				&lt;/html&gt;
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>with that code set I proceeded to test out various css tags, such as color and background as well as width padding.
			Once I started to get a handle on things I downloaded boostrap and added the css file to the page to
			begin to get a feel for it. I used bootstrap's containers to hold the navbar and the body, but decided to style the navbar
			with  my own css.</p>
		<pre>
			<code class="language-css">
			.nav a:link, .nav a:visited{
				color:white;
				text-align:center;
				text-decoration: none;
				display: inline-block;
				padding:0px 10px;
				margin-right:10px;
			}
			.nav a:hover{
				color:gray;
			}
			.nav{
				border-radius: 10px;
				border: 2px solid #000000;
				background: #000000;
				color: #FFFFFF;
				margin: 10px;
				padding: 15px;
			}
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>I went around looking at different options for what you could do to navbars and settled on this.
			Next I added in two more pages and linked them all together, then filled one with a table and the other with
			two columns and two lists. For the main page I filled in a couple paragraphs with lorem ipsum filler text. From
			what I gathered the main purpose of this project was more to show we could make a website and less to fill it with
			actual content.
		</p>
		<h3>Finishing the Website</h3>
		<p>To finish up I tweaked some of the CSS to make the layout look similar across the pages and the went on to
			create the github pages repo so I could upload the website to the web. Creating the landing page in markdown
			was easier than I thought. I'd never worked with it before but after seeing it in class and looking it up on the
			web it was pretty intuitive to make a basic page.

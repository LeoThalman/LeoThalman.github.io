		<h1>Homework Three</h1>
		  <p>For this assignment we had to use visual studio to create an ASP.NET MVC 5 web application. This web application has 4 pages
			including the index page. The first page uses the request object to pull data out of the the view. The second page uses a FormCollection 
			object that is passed to the action method to pull data out of the view. The third page uses model binding to retrieve the data from the view.
			The purpose of this assignment was to learn the basics of ASP.NET MVC 5 and model binding.</p>
		  <p>The assignment can be found <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW4.html">here</a></p>
		  <p>The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/LeoThalman/HW4">here</a></p>
		  <p>Demo can be found <a href="/HW4/HW4/Views/Home/Index.cshtml">here</a></p>
		  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
		  <p>The first thing to do was create an empty MVC web application project. After making the project and making sure it added
		  the correct MVC folders I linked the local and remote repos and then created a branch for home called home-feature. With that done
		  I added a controller named HomeController and began working on the index page. The base code it generated gave me a action method was the following.</p>
		  <pre>
			<code class="language-csharp">
			using System;
			using System.Collections.Generic;
			using System.Diagnostics;
			using System.Linq;
			using System.Web;
			using System.Web.Mvc;

			namespace HW4.Controllers
			{
				public class HomeController : Controller
				{
					// GET: Home
					public ActionResult Index()
					{
						return View();
					}
				}
			}
			</code>
		  </pre>
		  <p>I created a view off Index then a new branch name page1-feature and started working on the first of the three pages. For the get
			method I made it the same as Index and created the view where I began to enter in the form data. The post method had to create a new page
			so I linked the form to a separate view that I would create later. After that I filled out the label and input data similar to the example
			from the lecture.
		  </p>
		  <pre>
			<code class="language-html">
				&lt;form method="post" action="/Home/Page1Text"&gt;
					&lt;label for="temp"&gt;Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit&lt;/label&gt;
					&lt;input type="number" name="temp" value="" /&gt;
					&lt;label for="tempType"&gt;Temp to Convert to (C or F)&lt;/label&gt;
					&lt;input type="text" name="tempType" value="" /&gt;
					&lt;input type="submit" name="submit" value="Convert" /&gt;
				&lt;/form&gt;
			</code>
		  </pre>
		  <p>With the form done I was able to begin working on the Page1Text method that would pull the data out of the form and begin
			converting temperature and error checking. To get the data from the page I used Request.Form based on the name of the input
			to assign the data to the variables so I could work with it. After passing it through some error checking and converting it 
			the correct temp I sent it the separate page which would give your answer or error message.
		  </p>
		  <pre>
			<code class="language-csharp">
				public ActionResult Page1Text()
				{
				if (Request.Form["temp"] != null && Request.Form["tempType"] != null)
				{
					string temp = Request.Form["temp"];
					string tempType = Request.Form["tempType"];
					ViewBag.Title = "Page 1";
					tempType = tempType.ToLower();
					if (Double.TryParse(temp, out double nTemp))
					{
						if (tempType.Equals("c"))
						{
							nTemp = (nTemp - 32) / 1.8;
							nTemp = Math.Round(nTemp, 2);
							ViewBag.Message = "Your temp is " +  nTemp.ToString();

						}
						else if (tempType.Equals("f"))
						{
							nTemp = (nTemp * 1.8) + 32;
							nTemp = Math.Round(nTemp, 2);
							ViewBag.Message = "Your temp is " + nTemp.ToString();
						}
						else
						{
								ViewBag.Message = "Invalid Temperature type, please enter C or F";
						}
					}
						else
						{
							ViewBag.Message = "Please enter a Temp number";
						}
				}
				return View();
				}
			</code>
		  </pre>
		 <p>With the first page done I merged the branch back into home-feature and added a link to it from homepage. I then 
		 created a new branch called page2-feature and begain working on the Page with FormCollection passed into it. The get method 
		 was the same as the last and the view I created had a similar form to enter data in. The main difference was in the method signatures
		 themselves. For the get I added an attribute right above to label it as a get method ( [HttpGet] ) and the post method had a [HttpPost]
		 attribute above it as well as a FormColletion form parameter. The form parameter was how I got the data from the page, and the I proceeded
		 to convert the time from hours to minutes or minutes to hours.</p>
		 
		 <pre>
			<code class="language-csharp">
				[HttpPost]
				public ActionResult Page2(FormCollection form)
				{
					string time = Convert.ToString(form["time"]);
					string timeType = Convert.ToString(form["timeType"]);
					ViewBag.Title = "Hour/Minute Converter";
					timeType = timeType.ToLower();
					if (Double.TryParse(time, out Double nTime))
					{
						if(timeType.Equals("h"))
						{
							nTime = nTime / 60;
							nTime = Math.Round(nTime, 2);
							ViewBag.Message = "Your time is " + nTime.ToString();
						}
						else if (timeType.Equals("m"))
						{
							nTime = nTime * 60;
							nTime = Math.Round(nTime, 2);
							ViewBag.Message = "Your time is " + nTime.ToString();
						}
						else
						{
							ViewBag.Message = "Please Enter H or M to convert to" + time.ToString();
						}
					}
					else
					{
						ViewBag.Message = "Please enter a time";
					}
					return View();
				}
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p> Once that was done I merged the branch back into home-feature and updated the homepage with a link and started on page3 in its own branch.
			I had some experience with the formula for loan calculator from business classes I had taken so implementing that wasn't going to be too challenging.
			Again the get method and view page we're pretty much the same as the last. The post method however was a lot different from the rest. Instead of pulling data
			through requests or forms I used model binding in the parameters to link the values from the input directly to the method. With those linked I passed
			the three parameters to a separate method for error checking, if all was good I cast the values to into new variables that were doubles so I 
			could figure out the loan information. I have them as nullable types in the parameters so that if the user doesn't enter data in a field it doesn't crash.
		</p>
		 <pre>
			<code class="language-csharp">
				[HttpPost]
				public ActionResult Page3(double? principal, double? interest, double? termLength)
				{
					ViewBag.Title = "Loan Calculator";
					ViewBag.errMessage = null;
					if (LoanCheck(principal, interest, termLength))
					{
						ViewBag.errMessage = "Please enter a value in all 3 fields";
					}
					else
					{
						double prin = (double)principal;
						double iRate = (double)interest;
						double numP = (double)termLength;
						iRate = iRate * .01;
						iRate = iRate / 12;
						double payment = 0;
						payment = (iRate * prin) / (1 - Math.Pow((1 + iRate), -numP));
						double total = payment * numP;
						total = Math.Round(total, 2);
						payment = Math.Round(payment, 2);
						ViewBag.mPay = "Your monthly payment is $" + payment.ToString();
						ViewBag.tPay = "Your total payment is $" + total.ToString();
					}
					return View();
				}
			</code>
		</pre>
		<p>With that done I merged the page3-feature branch into home-feature and linked the page in the index. After I went through and double checked all the comments and
			made sure both errors and the intended output worked right.</p>

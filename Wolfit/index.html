		<h1>Wolfit</h1>
		<p>Wolfit is a simple Reddit style app developed in Python that was given to us with a monolithic architecture from which we had to migrate it to a microservices architecture. Along with learning about working with an existing codebase we also learned to utilize Test Driven Development, Cloud Deployment through Heroku, Load Balancing with nginx, working with both SQL and NoSQL databases, and creating and using REST APIs. The microservice that we migrated out was the Activity Log function, to which we switched over from a SQL database to a NoSQL database so that multiple apps could use the Activity Log API for logging..</p>
